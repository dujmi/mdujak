    When Lucasfilm lets you down for the <i>nth</i> time (<i>Andor’s</i> the exception),
    a man’s gotta find his entertainment elsewhere. For me, that became sports. Although
    this blog leans heavily on numbers, the goal is to explore that space between
    logic and emotion — where the game truly happens. I can’t promise every pop culture
    reference will land, or that posts will drop like clockwork, but hey — at least
    it won’t take as long as <i>Winds of Winter</i> or Everton’s next title.
